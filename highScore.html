                <p>We created this game with the mindset of helping users improve their short term memory as well as
                    their visual recognition. Our game focus is to nurture the users attention to detail. Many studies
                    showcase that memory games improve the brain functions such as focus and concentration. The best
                    part about our game is that the user can play the game multiple times and based on their scores they
                    can see how much they have improved overtime. The benefit of our website is that it doesnâ€™t matter
                    where you start in terms of your memory because you can always improve.

                <p>We would like to give credit to the following people who helped us overcome certain areas of
                    difficulty in our code and were there when we needed them. Sheyna stepped up at a point where our
                    JavaScript did not function at all due to numerous bugs. There were multiple occasions where Justin
                    showed us how to raise the right questions in order to follow through with our tasks. And the last
                    person that deserves credit would be Tammy. She was there all the late nights that we needed her to
                    help us sort out numerous CSS bugs.
