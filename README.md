## Summary of idea

User looks for pairs of cards by selecting them via a mouse click and attempts to find a matching pair. If you find a match, you get a point and your attempt continues to select 2 more cards. 3 attempts are allowed and one attempt is not expended until a pair is not matched. The highest score will be provided with the most pair matches given for 3 attempts

What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
The user gets to exercise their memory ability by looking for current icons, logos, and pictures of current social media, personalities, and organizations that are in Todayâ€™s popular culture. This application gives credence to research to help prevent online bullying backed up by The Office of the eSafety Commissioner into the use of online gaming by young people in July 2017. The research found that around 60% of young people played online games and stay away from negative online presence. Finally this application allows users to have fun while looking for a job in software development.
